# 03 Python - PyBank & PyPoll

## Background

This repository contains two python projects: PyBank and PyPoll. Inside of each folder, there is:
1. The main script file called main.py that returns a print of the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
2. A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used.
3. An "Analysis" folder that contains a text file that has the conclusions from the analysis.

## PyBank

The financial dataset is called budget_data.csv and is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The goal is to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company, that calculates each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


## PyPoll

The poll dataset is called election_data.csv and is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The goal is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
